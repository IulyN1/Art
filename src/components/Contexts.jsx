					<strong>Museum Context: </strong>
					<span>
						Art is an interactive experience, shaped by the design of exhibitions, the viewer&apos;s
						engagement, and the social setting, which influence its appreciation and emotional impact.
					</span>
				</div>
				<div className="definition">
					<strong>Natural Environments: </strong>
					<span>
						Art often aligns with the innate human tendency to find beauty in nature, evoking peace,
						connection, and positive emotional responses.
					</span>
				</div>
				<div className="definition">
					<strong>Urban/Built Environments: </strong>
					<span>
						Art in cities and architecture enhances aesthetic appreciation while influencing social
						behaviors and relationships through designed spaces.
					</span>
				</div>
				<div className="definition">
					<strong>Ecological Contexts: </strong>
					<span>
						Art in everyday or ecological settings becomes a multidimensional experience, linked to
						emotional resonance, intellectual engagement, and a sense of discovery.
					</span>
				</div>
				<div className="definition">
					<strong>Laboratory Settings: </strong>
					<span>
						Art is studied as a cognitive and emotional process, often losing the richness of context but
						allowing for controlled insights into perception and reaction.

				I believe that every piece of creation and everything that surrounds us is a form of artâ€¦ Therefore I

					<strong>A Void or Total Isolation: </strong>
					<span>
						A piece of art placed in an entirely inaccessible location, like the vacuum of space far beyond
						human reach or instruments to detect it, would challenge its existence as <i>&quot;art&quot;</i>{' '}
						since it would lack an audience to engage with it.

					<strong>A Context Without Cognition: </strong>

						Environments inhabited solely by beings incapable of perceiving or interpreting stimuli (e.g.,
						purely mechanical systems or unreactive matter) would render art meaningless.
